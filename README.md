# Customer Analytics Preparing Data for Modeling
**Efficient Dataset Storage Solution**

In the domain of data science, optimizing dataset storage is crucial for accelerating model training and inference processes, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. This project aims to develop an efficient storage solution for a sizable customer dataset, enhancing the agility and scalability of data-driven applications.

**Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to create a proof-of-concept for a more efficient storage solution for a customer dataset provided by Training Data Ltd. The dataset, available in customer_train.csv, contains anonymized student information and indicators of their job-seeking status during training. By optimizing the dataset storage, we aim to expedite model predictions and improve overall performance.

**Approach**
**Data Exploration:**

1. Understand the dataset's structure and characteristics.
2. Identify potential areas for optimization while preserving data integrity.

**Data Cleaning and Optimization:**

1. Convert data types to more memory-efficient formats.
2. Utilize categorical data types for nominal and ordinal variables.
3. Filter the dataset to focus on relevant subsets based on business requirements.
4. Proof-of-Concept Implementation:

Implement the optimized storage solution using Python and pandas library.
Validate the effectiveness of the solution through memory usage comparison.

**Documentation:**

Document the approach, implementation steps, and outcomes.
Provide instructions for replicating the optimization process.

**Dataset Description**
The customer_train.csv dataset includes anonymized student information, such as:

1. student_id
2. city
3. city_development_index
4. gender
5. relevant_experience
6. enrolled_university
7. education_level
8. major_discipline
9. experience
10. company_size
11. last_new_job
12. training_hours
13. job_change

**Proof-of-Concept Outcome**
We expect to observe a significant reduction in memory usage after implementing the optimized storage solution, enabling faster model predictions and more efficient data analysis workflows.

**Conclusion**
Efficient dataset storage is paramount for enhancing the performance and scalability of data-driven applications. By optimizing our dataset storage approach, we aim to accelerate model training and inference processes, ultimately delivering greater value to our clients.
